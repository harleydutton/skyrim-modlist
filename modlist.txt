IDEAS FOR NEW MODS
something to make NPC's pick your pockets
add activatable effects to items
dragon AI upgrade (no hovering, attack while flying, harder ground combat)
something to melt down items into metals
changes to stealth, agression, and detection
combat overhaul
some kind of dodge mod

TODO
remove the 'OPTIONAL' and 'UNDER REVIEW' sections
add a legend describing mods that were formerly in those categories
reorganize this in some fashion

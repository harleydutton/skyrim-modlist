README
this skyrim modlist is for the 'ebony warrior' challenge. the goal is to kill
the ebony warrior with a character in any way while using this modlist and
settings config the whole playthrough. mods listed with a '????' prefix are 
optional. mods are frequently added based on the rules laid out in the 
'addition procedure' section below.

ADDITION PROCEDURE
x.   anyone may add a new mod to the bottom of 'pending' at any time
1.   everyone uses the mod at the top of the 'pending' list in addition to core
2.   everyone plays a few runs and votes to add the mod to core or not
3.a. if it passes unanamously it is added to core or optional
3.b. if it fails unanamously it is removed from 'pending'
3.c. otherwise it is moved to the bottom of 'pending'
4.   at the end of each vote each player may move one mod one slot up the list

STARTUP SETTINGS
frostfall - enable, death at max exposure
ihud - enemy hp bar off

IDEAS FOR NEW MODS
NPC's pick your pockets
add activatable effects to items
dragon AI upgrade (no hovering, attack while flying, harder ground combat)
melt down items into metals
changes to stealth, agression, and detection
combat overhaul
dodge mod
more non-violent random encounters

TODO
reorganize the mod sections
spellcheck this
add links for the mods
find out if ordinator and apocalypse need a compatibility patch (probably)
flesh out 'startup settings'. use as many defaults as possible.
the current modlist is organized by our design philosophy. maybe add another
organized by the vortex mod manager categories so it is easier to compare.
